MODELS:
user: name, email, profile, auth? (password, salt, or gem?)
profile: city, joined date, picture, bio, website, theme color, birthday
tweet: sender (fk to user), created_at, content, retweet, original tweeter, retweeter
following: followee_id, fk to user table (indexed?), follower_id, fk to user table (indexed?)


FEATURES:
follow
unfollow
tweet
list followees (sort?)
list followers (sort)
list all tweets by somebody (or self)
private message
#'s ?
retweets, seems @ original tweeter goes at front?, retweeted by at the end
content
lists
block
mute
favorites
@'s (not sure how that actually works), seems to take to that person



BEHAVIORS:
authentication
 -- before filters, session controller
-- protect_from_forgery?
-- if user is not signed in, go to authenticate user (?!)
-- if logged in, offer up partial containing log out button/option



QUESTIONS:
in config_master wtf is new_session_url defined


PLAN:
start with auth

PROBLEMS with devise:
where is my cookie?
i can't find a log out anywhere
multiple users how?
there is a remember me button but it just remembers anyway!
also no username at signup
i can be signed in with chrome and firefox at the same time



Got auth working, now what?
Need to produce a main controller, but named what?
What actions will there be?
follow somebody
see who follows you
send a tweet
read somebodys tweets (can be on user page)
so maybe.....  users/self and /other ?  and maybe /showall or /suggestions?






===============================================================================

From devise:
Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root to: "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.

  5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g devise:views
